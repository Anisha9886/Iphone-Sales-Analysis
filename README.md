# Iphone-Sales-Analysis

The iPhone Flipkart Sales Analysis project was a deep dive into exploring how customer ratings, reviews, prices, and discounts impact iPhone sales on Flipkart! ðŸ“±ðŸ“Š

I analyzed which iPhones have the highest ratings, uncovered the iPhone with the most reviews, and discovered interesting relationships between sale prices and customer engagement. One key insight? Lower sale prices often drive more ratings, but higher discounts donâ€™t always guarantee more reviews! ðŸ’¡ I also looked into how discounts affect customer feedback, revealing trends that can help improve marketing strategies.

It was fascinating to see how pricing and customer sentiment are connected and how these insights can help brands optimize their sales on e-commerce platforms. ðŸš€
